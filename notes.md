1. Render a list of books that show the book title and book image in the Book List
2. Clicking on a book in the Book List should add it to the Bookshelf
3. Clicking on a book in the Bookshelf should remove it from the Bookshelf

4. Create a controlled form that allows the user to add a book to the Book List (this should NOT persist)

BONUS: Each book can only be added to Bookshelf once (Bookshelf should not have duplicate books)
BONUS: Allow newly added books to persist (optimistic rendering or pessimistic rendering)
